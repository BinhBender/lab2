    And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
    The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
    :htrae ym fo ydal lufepoh eht si ehS
    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
    My will to her consent is but a part;
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Such as I love; and you, among the store,
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    :thgil nevaeh krad ekam taht srats gnidaert-htraE
    thgin siht dloheb ot kool esuoh roop ym tA
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    When well-apparell'd April on the heel
    Of limping winter treads, even such delight
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
    And like her most whose merit most shall be:
    Which on more view, of many mine being one
    May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
    Come, go with me.

    To Servant, giving a paper
    Go, sirrah, trudge about
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

    Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
